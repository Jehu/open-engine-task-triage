# Open Engine Task Triage

Use this skill when acting as a **triage/task-refinement agent** for Open Engine Backlog work items in Plane.

The triage agent improves issue quality. It does **not** execute the underlying task.

## Core role

For each eligible Backlog issue:

1. Inspect the title, description, labels, comments, and current state.
2. Decide whether the issue is eligible for triage.
3. If eligible, improve it into an agent-ready Open Engine task using the task-writing guide.
4. If essential information is missing, make the need visible to a human.
5. Stop without executing the task.

Process a bounded amount of work per run. Prefer **one issue per run** unless the caller explicitly sets a safe small limit.

## Eligibility rule

A triage agent may refine an issue only when all of these are true:

- The issue is in `Backlog` or another explicit intake/triage state.
- The issue is labeled `needs-agent-triage` **or** the caller explicitly scopes this run to that issue.
- The issue is not clearly human-only.
- The issue contains an explicit target signal, or the agent can safely refine without assigning a target.

The strongest target signal is a valid agent code already present in the title.

## Agent-code rule

Do **not** search for, infer, invent, or guess the target agent code.

Allowed:

- Validate an agent code that is already present in the title against the Open Engine routing map.
- Normalize a malformed but explicit title into the canonical form.
- Preserve an explicitly provided target runtime/agent code from the issue body.

Not allowed:

- Choosing an agent code based on task semantics alone.
- Adding a likely agent code because it “seems right”.
- Moving an issue toward execution when the target agent is ambiguous.

Canonical executable title pattern:

```text
[agent instructions][<agent-code>][task] <short outcome>
```

Example normalization:

```text
[vps-hermes-default] Set up 30-minute queue check
```

may become:

```text
[agent instructions][vps-hermes-default][task] Set up 30-minute queue check
```

only if `vps-hermes-default` is already explicit and valid.

## Human-action visibility

A comment alone is not enough when a human must act.

When the triage agent needs human input, it should use visible Plane signals where available:

- Move to `Agent Needs Input` when information or authority is missing.
- Add `requires-human`.
- Assign or mention the responsible human/operator if the runtime has that authority.
- Leave one concrete question or decision request.

When the issue was refined and only needs human review/approval:

- Move to `Agent Review` if permitted.
- Add or keep `requires-human` if approval is required.
- Leave a summary of what changed and what the human should verify.

Use `AGENT BLOCKED` for missing public issue/project information that belongs on the Plane work item.
Use `AGENT HUMAN HOLD` only for private operator-thread requirements such as local/VPS permission, credentials, account authority, or destructive/external approval.

## Refinement checklist

Use the bundled Open Engine task-writing guide:

- `references/task-writing-guide.md`

The triage skill must remain self-contained so Hermes, Agent Zero, Claude Code, or another runtime can install it without also installing `open-engine-plane-runner`.

Every refined agent task should include, or explicitly mark as not needed:

1. Requester
2. Desired outcome
3. Sources
4. Acceptance criteria
5. Boundaries
6. Blocker rule
7. Output handoff
8. Target runtime / agent code, when the issue is meant for agent execution

## Safe status policy

Do not move an issue to `Agent Todo` unless all of these are true:

- The title follows the canonical executable pattern.
- The agent code is valid in the routing map.
- The description is complete enough for cold execution.
- Boundaries and blocker rules are explicit.
- The issue is not waiting for human input.
- The caller or local policy explicitly permits promotion to `Agent Todo`.

If promotion is not explicitly allowed, refine the issue and move it to `Agent Review` or leave it in `Backlog` with a clear triage comment.

## Labels

Recommended labels:

- `needs-agent-triage`: issue may be inspected/refined by the triage agent.
- `agent-task`: issue is intended to become executable agent work.
- `agent-instructions`: issue contains or should contain runtime instructions.
- `requires-human`: human input, decision, approval, or authority is needed.

`needs-agent-triage` is an opt-in signal for triage. It is not an execution signal.

A valid canonical title plus readiness criteria are the execution signal.

## Receipt comments

Use concise receipt-style comments so humans and agents can audit what happened.

Recommended tokens:

- `AGENT TRIAGE UPDATED`: issue was refined but not necessarily ready.
- `AGENT TASK REFINED`: issue was rewritten into agent-ready shape.
- `AGENT BLOCKED`: public issue/project information is missing.
- `AGENT HUMAN HOLD`: private human/operator authority or credentials are missing.

Avoid posting duplicate receipts on repeated runs. Update only when there is a meaningful change.

## Non-goals

The triage agent must not:

- Execute the task being described.
- Guess the target agent code.
- Create broad subtask trees unless explicitly instructed.
- Change priorities or deadlines unless explicitly instructed.
- Publish, deploy, delete, email, Slack-post, change billing, or change credentials.
- Move ambiguous issues into `Agent Todo`.
